This section contains a partially-annotated reading list compiled by a handful of Ethereum Foundation affiliates and student volunteers.

**The goal of this reading list is to give readers a feeling for the "why?" behind decentralized technologies.** Different people care about crypto technologies for different reasons. Some believe in the importance of decentralization for commerce; some believe it may allow us to build stronger and more robust institutions; some believe in the importance of cryptography/decentralization for the preservation of privacy; some believe in cryptography for its potential to redistribute power. There is no single narrative around why cryptography and decentralization matter, but the essays and books in this section should give you a taste.
