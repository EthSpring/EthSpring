A collection of books and essays about the history of computing and the Internet that we particularly liked.

**_How the Internet Happened_** (Brian McCullough, 2018)

- A survey of a lot of the major historical moments in software over the last 30 years, from the invention of the Internet and the first browsers, to the iPhone and mobile computing.
- This book is great for getting a sense of the sort of energy and principles that pervaded early Internet culture.

**_Masters of Doom_** (David Kushner, 2003)

- A look at Id Software, one of the most legendary game studios in history. Id Software built _Doom_ and _Quake_, which are widely credited with accelerating graphics technology by years and opening up entirely new genres in digital gaming.

**_The Internet is My Religion_** (Jim Gilliam, 2015)

- A memoir by the late Jim Gilliam, an early Internet pioneer. Like _HTIH_, this book does a great job at conveying the energy of the early Internet days.

**_On Computing Machinery and Intelligence_** (Alan Turing, 1950)

- Fairly short and reads like a blog post!
- A seminal paper by Alan Turing about computation, artificial intelligence, and their implications. Not directly related to crypto, but I think this is a great example of first-principles thinking and far-reaching vision that anyone interested in topics in computer science should read.

**_True Names and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier_** (2001)

- A collection of essays about cypherpunk culture, early virtual spaces, the encryption wars, and more. Focused around a short story (_True Names_), listed below.

**_The Infinite Machine_** (Camila Russo, 2020)

- A history of Ethereum and many of the colorful characters involved in its founding and initial development.
