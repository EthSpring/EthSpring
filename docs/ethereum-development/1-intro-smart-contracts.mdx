Concretely, decentralized applications are constructed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. In web development terms, you can think of smart contract as the backend + database of your application.

A smart contract is comprised of two main components:

- Code (its functions)
- Data (its state)

Both the code and the data of a smart contract is stored as a single entity in a specific on the Ethereum blockchain. (Similar to a singleton class pattern) Much like a backend in web development context, you can interact with smart contracts through an Ethereum node via any client of your choice.
