In the previous chapter, Ethereum Development, we went over smart contracts. In web development terms, smart contracts can replace the backend/database of an application. But, most users would also like a nice graphical front-end to interact with.

In centralized web apps, we had the client-server model where the server was centrally managed. In decentralized web apps, we have the client-smart contract model.

These decentralized applications (dapps) are typically more transparent than centralized applications. In this chapter, we'll go into a comparison of a few dapps vs their centralized counterparts.

**Note**: Transaction fees on Ethereum right now are high. So, we recommend doing the below quests on a test net. [Ethereum networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) - with a list of testnets and links to faucets for free testnet ETH

Learning goals:

- Read instructions and watch videos from reading list and complete the quests, to get a hands on feeling of how Ethereum Apps work;
- Learn about the mechanics of the apps, understand why they are designed that way;
- Look at the smart contracts, e.g. see how ERC20/ERC721 are implemented, how factory contract, contract upgrade works in production.
