Best for students who are interested in building Dapps later in week 3 and 4, but doesn't have much prior experience with Ethereum. We'll show you how some of the most popular Dapps work and their implementations.

**Note**: Eth price is really high right now, so the gas cost is pretty high too. For the quests below, if you do any of them on a testnet, it works too.

[Ethereum networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/) - with a list of testnets and links to faucets

Learning goals:

- Read instructions and watch videos from reading list and complete the quests, to get a hands on feeling of how Ethereum Dapps work;
- Learn about the mechanics of the Dapps, understand why they are designed that way; Furthermore, why they are built on Ethereum, what's the benefits of decentralization;
- Look at the smart contracts, e.g. see how ERC20/ERC721 are implemented, how factory contract, contract upgrade works in production.
