A lot of people donâ€™t understand what an NFT is. So what is an NFT, hereâ€™s some example code of an NFT written in pseudo-python.

```python
class EvansFirstNFT():
    def init():
        # caller is a keyword that represents who called the function
        self.owner = caller

    def transferTo(recipient):
        if caller == self.owner:
            self.owner = recipient

    def owner():
        return self.owner

    def uri():
        return "https://ethspring.com/nft/EvansFirstNFT.json"
```

The code above is deployed to the blockchain. Clearly though, there is a URL to some data that's off-chain on the Eth Spring servers. This metadata has important information such as the title of the NFT, description, and the artwork jpeg. An NFT could modify its code to have that data stored on chain, but the costs are higher so thereâ€™s a trade off to be made.

## Readings

The first recommended reading for newbies in the NFT space is [The Anatomy of ERC721](https://medium.com/crypto-currently/the-anatomy-of-erc721-e9db77abfc24). They do a good job of explaining what "non-fungible" (the NF in NFT) means.

## **Quests**

- [ ] Buy and breed a [CryptoKitty](https://www.cryptokitties.co/)
- [ ] Draw something on [nifty.ink](http://nifty.ink) and mint the NFT, send it to another address; (Optional) upgrade it to the Ethereum mainnet, and sell it on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/); use your ENS name to sign your artwork for true authenticity
- [ ] (Optional) Purchase an NFT digital asset on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)
