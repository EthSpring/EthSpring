DeFi (short for "decentralized finance") refers to a variety of financial applications built on blockchains. DeFi applications are smart contracts that allow participants to participate in financial actions like borrowing and lending, without needing intermediaries or trusted third-parties like a bank or broker.

The key benefit to moving 99% of finance on to a blockchain is that it allows regular people to participate in the financial system in ways they can't today. For example, most people don't know what a market maker is, even if they did know, they'd have a hard time becoming one. Via Uniswap, anyone can become a market maker.

## Trading

Trading protocols let you swap one ERC20 token for another.

### Uniswap

**Quests**

- [ ] Swap some ETH for another ERC20 token (preferably Stablecoin like DAI) on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap)
- [ ] Add liquidity to a Uniswap pool
- [ ] (Optional) Remove liquidity from the Uniswap pool
- [ ] (Optional, advanced) Create your own ERC20 token, and add it to Uniswap

### Curve.fi

Curve.fi is an automated market maker similar to Uniswap, but trying to fix some of the issues with how Uniswap works. Please read the Uniswap section first.

[How do liquidity pools work? - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cizLhxSKrAc)

**Quests**

- [ ] Swap some stablecoins on curve.fi, e.g. DAI to USDC. What's the pros and cons vs. using Uniswap?
- [ ] (Optional) Provide liquidity to a pool (e.g. Pool #0 Compound) on [curve.fi](http://curve.fi) - select desired pool, go to "deposit" tab. Compare this to providing liquidity to a uniswap pool.

  To [boost your CRV rewards](https://resources.curve.fi/guides/boosting-your-crv-rewards), before deposit, you can use calculator to identify veCRV amount for 2.5x, mint veCRV with locker (must go buy CRV); and press "Deposit and stake in gauge" while deposit.

- [ ] Withdraw liquidity from a pool - select pool, go to "withdraw" tab.
- [ ] [Loopring](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-launches-zkrollup-exchange-loopring-io-d6a85beeed21) is another decentralized exchange. It is a "layer 2" exchange built with zkSNARKS. Make a transaction on [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/).

[Compound Governance](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-5531f524cf68)

- As part of this decentralization process, Compound upgraded their [smart contracts](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol) to shift from admin control to community governance. This is good example of how smart contracts are upgraded in production: worth looking into [ComptrollerInterface.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/ComptrollerInterface.sol); [Comptroller.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Comptroller.sol), [ComptrollerG1.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/ComptrollerG1.sol), [ComptrollerG2.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/ComptrollerG2.sol) - those are for different versions of logics; [ComptrollerStorage.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/ComptrollerStorage.sol) - this has the corresponding three versions of storage.

  For another smart contract upgrade example, see [USDC v2: upgrading a multi-billion dollar ERC-20 token](https://blog.coinbase.com/usdc-v2-upgrading-a-multi-billion-dollar-erc-20-token-b57cd9437096).

- In Compound, proposals are [executable code](https://app.compound.finance/vote), not suggestions for a team or foundation to implement. Once a proposal passed, it is queued in the [Timelock](https://app.compound.finance/timelock), and can be executed after a grace period. See the [smart contract code](https://compound.finance/docs/governance?ref=github&user=ajb413&repo=compound-governance-examples) and [docs](https://compound.finance/docs/governance?ref=github&user=ajb413&repo=compound-governance-examples).

**Quests**

- [ ] Supply some assets on [Compound](https://app.compound.finance/) to start earning interest, and borrow some assets, calculate how much $COMP you are earning using [compound calculator](http://www.predictions.exchange/compound/None). Can do this on a testnet.
- [ ] (Optional) [Aave](https://aave.com/) is another [lending protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTp9er6S73M). Deposit some ETH into [Aave](https://aave.com/) and start earning interest on your deposit from borrowers. **Note**: Given the amounts you'd be likely to deposit, your transaction fees will likely be much greater than the interest you earn. This quest is primarily for education purposesâ€”don't expect it to earn you a substantial amount of crypto!
