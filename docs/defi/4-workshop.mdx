### Why lend/borrow?

1. Short eth:
- Deposit USD in Aave
- Borrow ETH from Aave
- Sell the borrowed ETH into USD
- ??? wait for prices to drop
- Buy back the ETH at lower price
- Profit!!

1. Levered long eth:
- (have usd) Buy ETH ‚Üê100% exposure to ETH
- Deposit ETH in Aave (100$ worth of eth)
- Borrow USD from Aave (70$ worth of eth)
- Buy ETH with borrowed USD
- ??? wait for prices to go up
- Sell the ETH at higher price
- Profit!!

1. Yield arbitrage between markets

## Uniswap

Res A amount worth the same as Res b amount worth

e.g. pool containing 1000 USD and 2 ETH ‚áí 1 eth is worth 500 usd

Invariant: amount a * amount b = constant  ‚Äî (xy = k)

I will deposit 1000 usd, and withdraw x eth. What is x?

2000 USD * 2-x ETH = 2000

x = 1 eth

## Week 2 workshop 1: Flash Loans

Definition: A loan that is paid back (sometimes with fee), within the same transaction.

### Use cases

<aside>
üí° Note that anything that is enabled by a flash loan is also doable by somebody with a large amount of assets.

</aside>

- Reduce transaction complexity: Leveraging / deleveraging a loan, changing a loan's composition (collateral, refinancing, etc)

Deposit 100$ into Aave ‚Äî> $80 borrow power
Borrow $80 worth of ETH, and deposit it back into aave ‚Äî> 
$100, $80 in eth, and I owe $80 in eth ‚Äî> $64 borrow power remaining
    
    ...
    
    Flash loan a large amount of $, deposit it into aave ‚Äî> 80%  of a large amount borrow power
    Borrow end amount ‚Äî> 
    
    Aave pool has 50% collat ratio:
    
    deposit 1, borrow 0.5, deposit 0.5, borrow 0.25, ... ‚Üí 2 in collateral, and 1 in borrow
    
    Flash loan X, deposit X+1 into aave, borrow 1, withdraw X-1 ‚Äî> 2 in collateral, 1 in borrow, (end up with X in my wallet) ‚Äî> Repay flash loan of X.
    
- Democratizing arbitrage and liquidations ‚Üí (MEV)

Market 1: buy 1 ABC for 100000$
Market 2: sell 1 ABC for 80000$

buy from market 2, sell on market 1 ‚Äî> $20000 profit (you need $80000)

Stablecoins USDC, USDT, DAI, ...

### Hacks / Protocol Vulnerabilities

[https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-flash-loan-attacks](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-flash-loan-attacks)

Naively calculated on-chain prices can be manipulated within a transaction.

djSynths

deposit ETH ‚Üí djETH

deposit USDC ‚Üí djUSDC

allow you to swap djETH ‚Üî djUSDC for a price. That price is uniswap's ETH-USDC pool price.

Uniswap ETH-USDC spot price = amount of ETH / amount of USDC 

E.g. 2 eth, 100 USDC ‚Üí 1 eth is tradeable for 50 USDC.

I want to buy 1 eth ‚Üí (2-1) * (100 + X) = 2 * 100 ‚Üí X = 200 - 100 = 100$ per eth.

Need to pay 100 USDC to buy 1 ETH.

I want to buy 1.5 eth ‚Üí (2-1.5) * (100 + X) = 2 * 100 ‚Üí X = 200/0.5 - 100 = 300.

I want to buy 0.0000001 eth ‚Üí 50$ per eth (spot price)

Flash borrow 300. Buy 1.5 eth from uniswap pool ‚Üí uniswap pool 0.5 eth, 400 USDC (spot price 800$ / eth)

Swap 100 djETH for 800 * 100 = 80000 djUSDC.

Sell 1.5 eth into uniswap pool, get 300 USDC back ‚Üí uniswap pool 2 eth, 100 USDC

Pay back my 300$ flash loan

- Price oracle (chainlink)
- use TWAP prices
- sprinkle fees around

### Implementation details

Aave Flash Loans [https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans](https://docs.aave.com/developers/guides/flash-loans)

[https://github.com/aave/code-examples-protocol/blob/main/V2/Flash Loan - Batch/MyV2FlashLoan.sol](https://github.com/aave/code-examples-protocol/blob/main/V2/Flash%20Loan%20-%20Batch/MyV2FlashLoan.sol)

File 52 of 79 : LendingPool.sol [https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6845a5c768bf8d7681249f8927877efda425baf#code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6845a5c768bf8d7681249f8927877efda425baf#code)

Aave charges 9bps for the flash loan (quite expensive, considering Curve's 3pool charges 3bps for a swap!)

## Week 2 workshop 2: Synthetics

Synthetics are a subset of derivatives. It usually means a "delta one" derivative. I.e. the synthetic asset tracks the underlying asset almost 1-1.

### Why even have synthetic assets?

- Underlying asset is difficult to acquire or trade
    - Foreign stocks, complicated rules (e.g. dividend tax treatment across countries)
    - New exchange
    - Small float
- Example synthetics in tradfi: ADRs, futures, swaps,
- Different way of leveraging (more capital efficient)
- **Stablecoins** are a type of synthetic asset

### How do synthetic assets work?

How do trades work?

- What determines trade price?
- What's the trade fee?
- What's the market impact?
- Who is your counterparty?
