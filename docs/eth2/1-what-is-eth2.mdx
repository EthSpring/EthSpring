title: What is Eth2?

### Readings:

- [ ]  [Why Proof of Stake (Nov 2020)](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html)
    
    Why even change Proof of Work Ethereum? In this article, Vitalik gives some compelling arguments for a shift to Proof of Stake from a security/decentralization lens.
    
- [ ]  [Base Layers And Functionality Escape Velocity](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/26/mvb.html)
    
    You may have heard about 'Layer 2' as a way to scale Ethereum. What problems should we be solving in 'Layer 1' (Eth2) vs. 'Layer 2' (rollups, etc.)? Vitalik outlines a way to think about this here.
    
- [ ]  [History of Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/history/)
    
    This is more of a reference than something to read thoroughly, but it gives a good idea of the progression of changes in Layer 1 of Ethereum. Feel free to spend some time understanding the various changes happening in 'Eth1' separate from Eth2 as well (i.e. EIP1559, which should go live this week).
    
- [ ]  [A rollup-centric ethereum roadmap](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/a-rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap/4698)
    
    Finally, in this forum post, Vitalik lays out a perspective on the relationship between Layer 1 and Layer 2 in the short term. 
    
- [ ]  (optional) [EIP 1011](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1011.md) and the [reasons it didn't end up being the way forward](https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/rJDrKoBOQ?type=view)
    
    EIP 1011 is a proposal from 2018 for how a hybrid PoW/PoS chain might be adapted to mainnet very quickly. It was obviously discarded, but it's interesting to look back and understand why we collectively took the longer route.
