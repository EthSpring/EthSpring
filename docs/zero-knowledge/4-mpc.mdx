This section covers trusted setup, a process needed to generate the public parameters of a zkSNARK securely. We include some resources on the underlying mathematics and some resources on actually participating in an MPC.

[Scalable Multi-party Computation for zk-SNARK Parameters](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/1050.pdf): Math heavy. If you're glancing at this, I'd recommend prioritizing sections 1 and 2 of this paper.

[VDFs, or "Proof-of-Time"](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/VDFs-or-Proof-of-Time--BClyOYdUr4VaqhbNV8EwTRgDAQ-4h1N9a4ZcQH3KX5SdzVhy): Not directly related to zkSNARKs, but this is a useful cryptographic gadget used to finalize trusted setup parameters.

### Quests

- [ ] Participate in the Semaphore zkSNARK (Phase 2) Trusted Setup ceremony from your own computer! Follow [these instructions](https://hackmd.io/oja21FipQ5KhQcXeyuQWFQ?view) to participate. If you're curious, more detailed information about the ceremony can be found [here](https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore-phase2-setup/).
- [ ] Participate in the Perpetual Powers of Tau (Phase 1) Trusted Setup ceremony. **NOTE: This quest will likely require you to have dedicated hardware and some more technical experience. Contact Brian for more info.** Documentation on the ceremony is available [here](https://github.com/weijiekoh/perpetualpowersoftau).
